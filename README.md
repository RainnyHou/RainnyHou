 - Forget those official introduct issues. I am a student learning chemical engineering, sometimes will develop the 
tools helping me overcome some annoyed problem. I would like to store and publish some tools I have coded online.
But there may not more tools could be created originally. So, if you don't mind the codes I developed them more 
flexible -- or just to myself, we will get a well friendship, I think. If any question do you want to tell me,
please sent email to 156XXXX5067@163.com (to get the X, figure this simple equition：71a-87b=1)
